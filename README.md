# SENG498_Honours_Novel_Bias_Detection
This repository hosts the SENG 498 Honours Thesis project on "Novel Bias Detection in Machine Learning Models," by Abraham Rostampoor under the Supervision of Dr. Alex Thomo and the guidance of Shera Potka. The project focuses on using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology to uncover and analyze biases in large language models.
